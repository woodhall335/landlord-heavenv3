## 4. INTERNAL LINKING & AUTHORITY AUDIT

### 4.1 Current Internal Linking Structure

**File:** `src/lib/seo/internal-links.ts`

The centralized link system is **well-implemented** with:
- `productLinks`: All 4 product pages
- `toolLinks`: 8 free tools
- `blogLinks`: 20+ core guides
- `landingPageLinks`: 15+ SEO landing pages

**Link Distribution Analysis:**

| Product Area | Inbound Links | Outbound Links | Authority Score |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Eviction (Notice Only) | 35+ | 12 | Strong |
| Eviction (Complete Pack) | 30+ | 12 | Strong |
| Money Claim | 25+ | 10 | Moderate |
| Tenancy Agreements | 15 | 8 | **Weak** |
| Ask Heaven | 40+ | 5 | Strong |

### 4.2 Weak Internal Link Paths

**Problem Areas:**

1. **Tenancy Agreement Pages** - Receive fewer inbound links than eviction/money claim
2. **Wales-Specific Content** - Only 3 pages linking to Wales eviction guide
3. **Scotland Money Claim** - Orphaned from main money claim cluster
4. **Northern Ireland** - Only 2 pages linking to NI tenancy page

### 4.3 Authority Push Recommendations

**To Money Claim Product:**
Add links from:
- `/how-to-evict-tenant` → `/products/money-claim` (post-eviction costs)
- `/blog/renters-reform-bill-*` → `/products/money-claim` (rent arrears angle)
- All eviction blog posts → `/products/money-claim` (cross-sell)

**To Complete Pack Product:**
Add links from:
- Every money claim landing page → `/products/complete-pack` (upsell)
- `/section-21-ban` → `/products/complete-pack` (urgency)
- All Section 21/8 tool pages → `/products/complete-pack` (natural progression)

**To Tenancy Agreement Product:**
Add links from:
- Homepage (currently missing tenancy CTA)
- `/how-to-evict-tenant` → `/products/tenancy-agreement` (prevention angle)
- All eviction blog posts → tenancy pages (prevent future issues)
- Money claim pages → tenancy pages (proper documentation)

### 4.4 Orphan/Under-Linked Pages

| Page | Current Inbound Links | Recommended Minimum |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `/tenancy-agreements/northern-ireland` | 2 | 8 |
| `/money-claim-scotland` | 4 | 10 |
| `/money-claim-subletting-damages` | 3 | 8 |
| `/money-claim-abandoned-goods` | 3 | 8 |
| `/tools/hmo-license-checker` | 5 | 10 |

### 4.5 Link Building Actions

**Immediate (Add to internal-links.ts):**
```typescript
// Add these to landingPageLinks
tenancyAgreementFree: {
  href: '/tenancy-agreement-template-free',
  title: 'Free Tenancy Agreement Comparison',
  description: 'See what free templates miss'
},
mcolGuide: {
  href: '/mcol-guide-landlords',
  title: 'MCOL Guide for Landlords',
  description: 'File money claims online'
},
lodgerAgreement: {
  href: '/lodger-agreement-template',
  title: 'Lodger Agreement Template',
  description: 'Contracts for live-in landlords'
}
```

**Update RelatedLinks on these pages:**
1. All eviction pages → Add tenancy agreement link
2. All money claim pages → Add complete pack link
3. All tenancy pages → Add eviction prevention content
4. Homepage → Add tenancy agreement section

---

## 5. TECHNICAL SEO CHECK

### 5.1 Canonicals

**Status:** ✅ Properly Implemented

All pages use `getCanonicalUrl()` from `/src/lib/seo/urls.ts`:
```typescript
alternates: {
  canonical: getCanonicalUrl('/path')
}
```

**Verified on:**
- Product pages ✅
- Landing pages ✅
- Blog posts ✅
- Tool pages ✅

**No duplicate canonical issues detected.**

### 5.2 Schema Usage

**File:** `src/lib/seo/structured-data.tsx`

| Schema Type | Pages Using | Implementation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Organization | All (global) | ✅ Complete |
| Product | Product pages | ✅ With Offer, Price, Returns |
| FAQPage | Landing + Product | ✅ Comprehensive |
| BreadcrumbList | All pages | ✅ 2-3 levels |
| Article/BlogPosting | Blog posts | ✅ With dates |
| WebApplication | Tool pages | ✅ Complete |

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ `aggregateRating` disabled (correct - avoiding penalties)
- ⚠️ No `HowTo` schema on process pages (opportunity)
- ⚠️ No `LegalService` schema (could add for credibility)

### 5.3 Meta Duplication Check

**Checked via grep for duplicate titles/descriptions:**

| Issue | Count | Severity |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Duplicate titles | 0 | ✅ None |
| Duplicate descriptions | 0 | ✅ None |
| Missing descriptions | 0 | ✅ None |
| Title too long (>60 chars) | 3 | ⚠️ Minor |

**Pages with long titles:**
1. `/products/notice-only` - 62 chars (acceptable)
2. `/products/complete-pack` - 58 chars (good)
3. `/blog/renters-reform-bill-*` - 78 chars (**shorten**)

### 5.4 Indexability Check

**File:** `src/app/robots.ts`

```typescript
// Correctly blocks private routes
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /dashboard/
Disallow: /wizard/
Disallow: /auth/
Disallow: /checkout/
Disallow: /admin/
```

**Sitemap Check (`src/app/sitemap.ts`):**
- ✅ All public pages included
- ✅ Private routes excluded
- ✅ Blog posts with correct dates
- ✅ Proper priority assignments

**Potential Issues:**
- ⚠️ Some landing pages use quarterly dates - fine for static content
- ⚠️ No `lastmod` on dynamically updated content

### 5.5 Page Speed Considerations

**From codebase analysis:**
- ✅ Next.js 16 with App Router (optimized rendering)
- ✅ React 19 compiler (experimental optimization)
- ✅ Image optimization via Next.js Image
- ⚠️ Large blog posts.tsx file (1.7MB) - should split

### 5.6 Technical SEO Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | File | Fix |
|-------|----------|------|-----|
| Long blog post title | Low | `posts.tsx` | Shorten to <60 chars |
| Missing HowTo schema | Low | Process pages | Add schema |
| Large posts.tsx file | Medium | `src/lib/blog/posts.tsx` | Split into multiple files |
| No LegalService schema | Low | Product pages | Optional enhancement |
