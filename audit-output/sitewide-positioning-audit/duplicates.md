# Duplicate & Cannibalization Clusters

## Exact duplicate metadata clusters

1. **AST template cluster**
   - URLs: `/assured-shorthold-tenancy-agreement`, `/assured-shorthold-tenancy-agreement-template`, `/ast-template-england`, `/ast-tenancy-agreement-template`
   - Duplicate blocks:
     - Same title: `Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement Template 2026 | Legally Compliant AST | Landlord Heaven`
     - Same meta description focused on “download template… from £14.99”
   - Risk: These pages compete for the same AST intent and look like lateral doorway pages.
   - Differentiate by:
     - One page = **free/template intent**,
     - One page = **premium AST builder with validation logic**,
     - One page = **jurisdiction-specific comparison/selection**.

2. **Money-claim adjacency cluster (near-duplicate intent)**
   - URLs: `/money-claim`, `/products/money-claim`, plus long-tail `/money-claim-*` pages.
   - Duplicate blocks:
     - Repeated claim framing and overlapping “claim unpaid rent/damage” language.
   - Risk: Cannibalization between informational pillar and transactional product page.
   - Differentiate by:
     - `/money-claim` = educational pillar with pathways.
     - `/products/money-claim` = conversion page with deliverables/pricing/trust proof.

3. **Eviction template cluster (near-duplicate intent)**
   - URLs: `/eviction-notice-template`, `/section-21-notice-template`, `/section-8-notice-template`, `/eviction-notice`
   - Duplicate blocks:
     - Similar “template + notice” framing, overlapping CTA intent.
   - Risk: User uncertainty over which page is the “real” next step.
   - Differentiate by:
     - Template pages: informational + free starting tool.
     - `/eviction-notice`: premium workflow hub with jurisdiction routing + paid product bridge.

## Rewrite priorities (fastest impact)

1. Give each page a **single intent** in hero copy: learn, validate, or buy.
2. Add a **“Not just a template”** block on all template pages.
3. Add explicit **jurisdiction + validation logic** proof on product pages.
4. Standardize primary CTA labels so users can distinguish:
   - “Start free draft” (tool)
   - “Start court-ready workflow” (product/wizard)
