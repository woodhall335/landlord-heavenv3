# Funnel Map & Friction Audit

## Intended funnel flows

```text
SEO guide/template/tool
   -> relevant product page (/products/*)
      -> wizard (/wizard, /wizard/flow, /wizard/review)
         -> checkout
            -> success (/success/[product]/[caseId])
```

## Observed friction points

1. **Entry-page intent overlap**
   - Template pages, tools, and premium products overlap in language.
   - Result: users can stay in informational loops without committing.

2. **Competing CTA hierarchy**
   - Free tools and premium offers can appear as peers.
   - Result: high-intent traffic may divert to low-commitment tools.

3. **Value continuity gap**
   - Landing-page premium claims are not always reinforced step-by-step in wizard and checkout.
   - Result: confidence drops near payment.

4. **Insufficient “logic behind it” explanation**
   - Users may not understand why guided questions matter legally.
   - Result: product can feel like a form builder rather than legal workflow software.

## Drop-off hypotheses by step

- **SEO -> Product:** Users see template-like framing and delay purchase intent.
- **Product -> Wizard:** Deliverables and protection logic not concrete enough before start.
- **Wizard -> Checkout:** Fear of paying for “documents only” vs validated legal pathway.
- **Checkout -> Success:** Limited reassurance content and post-purchase momentum.

## Fixes that reduce bounce

1. Add above-fold “Choose your path” module: free template/tool vs premium court-ready workflow.
2. Use one dominant CTA per page and demote alternatives.
3. Add “What you get in 3 bullets” and “What we validate before output” directly under hero.

## Fixes that increase conversion

1. Add wizard-side trust panel: jurisdiction routing + legal checks completed in real-time.
2. Add checkout trust strip: compliance checks, update cadence, refund/guarantee clarity.
3. Add success-page expansion CTA: next legal step, enforcement, or bundle upsell.
