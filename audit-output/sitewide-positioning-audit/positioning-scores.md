# Positioning & Value Clarity Scores

## 5-second test scores (0–10)

| Page | Clarity | Differentiation | Trust | Actionability | Biggest bounce reason |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `/` | 7 | 5 | 6 | 6 | Mixed pathways can dilute immediate “what should I click next?” clarity. |
| `/products/notice-only` | 7 | 6 | 6 | 7 | Value vs free generators is not always explicit enough above fold. |
| `/products/complete-pack` | 8 | 7 | 7 | 7 | Premium offer strong, but “why this beats templates” can be more explicit. |
| `/products/money-claim` | 7 | 6 | 6 | 7 | Can be confused with money-claim guide pages without stronger conversion framing. |
| `/products/ast` | 7 | 5 | 6 | 7 | Strong overlap with AST template pages creates “which one is premium?” friction. |
| `/tools` | 6 | 4 | 5 | 6 | Free-tool framing can overshadow premium conversion path. |
| `/tools/validators/section-21` | 7 | 6 | 6 | 6 | Users may not see the paid next step after validation. |
| `/ask-heaven` | 7 | 7 | 6 | 5 | Q&A utility is clear, but product bridge CTA is weaker. |
| `/eviction-notice-template` | 6 | 4 | 5 | 6 | Template intent dominates; premium upgrade path not forceful enough. |
| `/section-21-notice-template` | 6 | 4 | 5 | 6 | Similar to above; reads like template page first. |
| `/money-claim-unpaid-rent` | 6 | 5 | 5 | 6 | Informational depth can delay action toward product funnel. |

## Product logic communication audit (plain-English)

### `/products/notice-only`
1. **What it does:** Helps landlords produce compliant eviction notice documents.
2. **What user gets:** Notice outputs and guided workflow artifacts.
3. **Behind-the-scenes logic shown:** Some legal/compliance positioning present, but specific checks are not consistently itemized.
4. **Missing for premium feel:** A concrete checklist of validation checks (deposit, EPC, gas safety, notice timing) and what failsafe handling occurs.

### `/products/complete-pack`
1. **What it does:** End-to-end eviction bundle from notice through court prep.
2. **What user gets:** Broader document pack and procedural guidance.
3. **Behind-the-scenes logic shown:** Better premium framing than most pages.
4. **Missing for premium feel:** Explicit court-bundle structure and “why each wizard question matters legally.”

### `/products/money-claim`
1. **What it does:** Guides landlords to prepare debt/damages claim documentation.
2. **What user gets:** Money-claim pack outputs and filing-oriented guidance.
3. **Behind-the-scenes logic shown:** Some quality signals, but legal checks are not crystal-clear in-page.
4. **Missing for premium feel:** Specific claim validation steps (pre-action protocol gating, evidence sufficiency checks, interest/cost logic).

### `/products/ast`
1. **What it does:** Produces a legally compliant tenancy agreement workflow.
2. **What user gets:** AST document output and clauses.
3. **Behind-the-scenes logic shown:** Compliance language exists, but differentiation from template pages is weak.
4. **Missing for premium feel:** Dynamic clause logic examples and jurisdiction-routing explanation that templates cannot provide.
