      <strong>Tenant Fees Act 2019 Compliance:</strong> This Agreement does not require the Tenant to use any particular cleaning company or provide receipts for cleaning services. The requirement is only that the Property is returned clean.

      Professional end-of-tenancy cleaning typically costs between {{#if cleaning_cost_estimate}}{{cleaning_cost_estimate}}{{else}}£80-250{{/if}} depending on property size.
      While not mandatory, many tenants find professional cleaning helpful to ensure they meet the required standard and protect their deposit.
      Keeping the Property clean throughout the tenancy makes end-of-tenancy cleaning easier.

### End of Tenancy Cleaning

The Tenant must return the Property in a clean and tidy condition, to the same standard as at the start of the tenancy (allowing for fair wear and tear).

**Cleaning Standard:** The Tenant is not required to use a professional cleaning company. However, the Property must be returned to a professional standard of cleanliness.

**Deposit Deductions:** If the Property is not returned clean, the Landlord may propose a reasonable deduction from the deposit to cover necessary cleaning costs. Any deduction must be evidenced (photographs, inventory reports) and is subject to the deposit scheme's dispute resolution process.
