      "Fair wear and tear" means the reasonable deterioration that occurs through normal, everyday use of the Property.
      Examples include minor scuffs on walls, gradual carpet wear in high-traffic areas, and fading of curtains from sunlight.
      Tenants are not responsible for fair wear and tear, but are responsible for damage caused by negligence,
      misuse, or failure to report issues that worsen over time.
