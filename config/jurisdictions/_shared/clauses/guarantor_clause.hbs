<div class="legal-notice">
  <div class="legal-notice-title">Guarantor Agreement</div>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <strong>The Guarantor agrees to act as guarantor for the Tenant(s) named above and undertakes the following obligations:</strong>
  </p>

  <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>1. Joint and Several Liability</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
      The Guarantor agrees to be jointly and severally liable with the Tenant for all obligations under this Agreement.
      This means the Guarantor may be held fully responsible for the Tenant's obligations, including the full rent amount,
      not just a proportionate share.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>2. Rent Payment Guarantee</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
      If the Tenant fails to pay rent when due, the Guarantor must pay the outstanding rent within 14 days of
      receiving written demand from the Landlord. This includes any rent arrears, plus interest on late payments
      at the rate specified in this Agreement.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>3. Damage and Dilapidation</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
      The Guarantor is liable for the cost of repairing or making good any damage to the Property caused by the Tenant
      beyond fair wear and tear, including cleaning costs, repair costs, and the cost of replacing damaged fixtures,
      fittings, or contents.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>4. Breach of Agreement</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
      If the Tenant breaches any term of this Agreement, the Guarantor must either remedy the breach or compensate
      the Landlord for any losses suffered as a result, including reasonable legal costs incurred in enforcement.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>5. Continuing Guarantee</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
      This guarantee continues throughout the tenancy, including any statutory periodic tenancy that arises after
      the fixed term expires. The guarantee remains valid even if the tenancy terms are varied by agreement between
      the Landlord and Tenant, provided such variation does not materially increase the Guarantor's liability without
      their consent.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>6. Maximum Liability</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
      The Guarantor's total liability under this guarantee is capped at:
      <strong>{{#if guarantor_max_liability}}{{guarantor_max_liability}}{{else}}twelve (12) months' rent{{/if}}</strong>,
      plus reasonable costs of enforcement. This cap does not limit the Guarantor's liability for rent arrears that
      accrue during the initial fixed term.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>7. Release of Guarantor</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
      The Guarantor will be released from this guarantee only when:
      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>The tenancy has ended and all obligations have been satisfied, OR</li>
        <li>The Landlord provides written release of the Guarantor, OR</li>
        <li>A replacement guarantor acceptable to the Landlord has been provided</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 10px 0;"><strong>8. Independent Legal Advice</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
      The Guarantor confirms they have been advised to seek independent legal advice before signing this guarantee
      and that they understand the full extent of their obligations. By signing, the Guarantor confirms they have
      either obtained such advice or have chosen not to do so.
    </p>

  </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 10px;">

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Read this entire Agreement carefully before signing</li>
