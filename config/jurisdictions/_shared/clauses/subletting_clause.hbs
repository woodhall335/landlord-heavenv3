      Subletting or assigning without consent is a breach of this Agreement. If the Tenant breaches this clause, the Landlord may:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Serve notice seeking possession under the applicable statutory grounds for breach of tenancy obligation</li>
      <li>Claim damages for any loss suffered, including increased insurance premiums and management costs</li>
      <li>Seek recovery of any profits the Tenant has made from the unauthorised arrangement</li>
      <li>Report unauthorised commercial activity to the local planning authority if applicable</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
      Any deposit deductions for breach of this clause will be subject to the tenancy deposit scheme's alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process and must be evidenced and reasonable.

  <div class="explainer-box">
    <div class="explainer-title">Why This Matters</div>
    <p>
      Subletting creates legal, financial, and safety concerns: the Landlord loses control over who occupies the Property,
      insurance may be invalidated, mortgage conditions may be breached, and planning or licensing requirements may be
      violated. Short-term letting platforms also create issues with neighbour disturbance and compliance with local
      regulations on short-term lets.
