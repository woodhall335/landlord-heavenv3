    <li>Use the Property for any trade, business, or profession</li>
    <li>Display any advertisement, sign, or notice at the Property</li>
    <li>Keep any goods or materials that would be a fire or safety hazard</li>
    <li>Do anything that causes nuisance, annoyance, or disturbance to neighbours</li>
    <li>Allow more persons to reside at the Property than stated in this Agreement</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Part B: Pets</h3>
  {{#if pets_allowed}}
  <table class="data-table">
    <tr>
      <td class="label">Pets Permitted</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="label">Approved Pets</td>
      <td class="value">{{approved_pets}}</td>
    </tr>
    {{/if}}
  </table>
  <p>The Tenant must ensure that any approved pets:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are kept under proper control at all times</li>
    <li>Do not cause nuisance, damage, or disturbance to neighbours</li>
    <li>Are up to date with vaccinations and parasite treatments</li>
    <li>Do not foul communal areas or neighbouring properties</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Tenant is liable for any damage caused by pets. The Landlord may require additional cleaning at the end of the tenancy if the Property has been occupied by pets.</p>

  <table class="data-table">
    <tr>
      <td class="label">Pets Permitted</td>
      <td class="value">No</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The Tenant must not keep any animals, birds, or reptiles at the Property without the Landlord's prior written consent. The Tenant may request consent in writing, and the Landlord will not unreasonably refuse such requests for well-behaved pets.</p>
  {{/if}}

  <h3>Part C: Smoking</h3>
  {{#if smoking_allowed}}
  <table class="data-table">
    <tr>
      <td class="label">Smoking Permitted</td>
      <td class="value">Yes, in designated areas only</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Smoking is permitted only in outdoor areas of the Property. The Tenant must dispose of smoking materials safely and keep ashtrays away from flammable materials.</p>
  {{else}}
  <table class="data-table">
    <tr>
      <td class="label">Smoking Permitted</td>
      <td class="value">No</td>

    <li>Allow any person not named in this Agreement to reside at the Property for more than 14 consecutive days without notifying the Landlord</li>
