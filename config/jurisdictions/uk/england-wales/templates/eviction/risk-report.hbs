IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

1. **This is Not Legal Advice**
   This risk assessment is based on the information you provided and general
   legal principles. It is not a substitute for professional legal advice.

2. **Courts Have Discretion**
   Even strong cases can face unexpected challenges. Courts consider tenant
   circumstances, proportionality, and public interest.

3. **Information Accuracy**
   This assessment assumes all information you provided is accurate and complete.
   If circumstances change, the assessment may no longer be valid.

4. **Success Not Guaranteed**
   A high risk score indicates likelihood, not certainty. Many factors affect
   case outcomes, including tenant defenses, court discretion, and procedural compliance.

5. **Update if Circumstances Change**
   If your case facts change (e.g., tenant pays arrears, new compliance issues
   arise, tenant makes counterclaim), regenerate this report with updated information.

==================================================================
