## 5. INFORMATION FOR TENANTS: WHAT TO DO IF YOU RECEIVE THIS NOTICE

### This notice requires you to give up possession of your home

It is very important that you read this notice carefully and take appropriate action. If you need help or advice, contact any of the organisations listed below.

### What this notice means

{{#if fixed_term}}
Your fixed-term tenancy is coming to an end. Your landlord is giving you notice that they want you to leave the property by {{possession_date}}, which is the end of your fixed term.
{{else}}
Your landlord is giving you notice that they want you to leave the property. You must leave by {{possession_date}}, which is at least two months from when you receive this notice.
{{/if}}

Your landlord does not have to give you a reason for asking you to leave.

### What you need to do

**Do not ignore this notice.** If you do not leave by the date given, your landlord can start court proceedings to evict you. You will then have to pay additional costs.

**1. Consider your options:**

- Do you want to leave? If so, start looking for alternative accommodation now
- Do you want to stay? If so, speak to your landlord - they may agree to extend your tenancy
- Are you having trouble finding somewhere else to live? Contact your local council's housing department for help

**2. Check if the notice is valid:**

This notice may not be valid if your landlord has not:
- Protected your deposit in a tenancy deposit scheme (if you paid a deposit)
- Given you the prescribed information about your deposit
- Provided you with a Gas Safety Certificate (if there are gas appliances)
- Provided you with an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) with a rating of at least E
- Provided you with the How to Rent guide (latest version)
- Properly licensed the property (if it's an HMO or in a selective licensing area)
- The notice was served during the first 4 months of your tenancy
- The notice was served within 6 months of you requesting repairs or complaining to the council about the property

**If you think the notice might not be valid, seek legal advice immediately.**

**3. Respond to your landlord:**

- Contact your landlord to discuss the notice
- Confirm receipt of the notice in writing
- Ask for clarification on anything you don't understand
- If you believe the notice is invalid, tell your landlord why

**4. Apply to your local council as homeless or threatened with homelessness:**

Your local council has a duty to help prevent homelessness. Contact them as soon as possible, ideally before the date given in this notice.

They can:
- Give you advice on your housing options
- Help you find alternative accommodation
- Make a homelessness application (if eligible)
- Provide temporary accommodation (if you qualify)

**Do not wait until you are evicted** - it is harder to get help if you have actually been evicted.

**5. Seek legal advice:**

Free legal advice is available from:

**Citizens Advice:**
- Website: www.citizensadvice.org.uk
- Phone: 0808 223 1133 (England) / 0808 223 1144 (Wales)

**Shelter (Housing Charity):**
- Website: www.shelter.org.uk
- Phone: 0808 800 4444
- Emergency helpline (if threatened with homelessness within 48 hours): 0808 800 4444

**Law Centres Network:**
- Website: www.lawcentres.org.uk

**Legal Aid:**
- Check if you qualify for free legal aid at: www.gov.uk/legal-aid

**Local solicitors:**
- Many solicitors offer a free initial consultation

### What happens next

**If you leave voluntarily:**
- Arrange an exit inspection with your landlord
- Return all keys
- Leave the property clean and in good condition
- Take meter readings
- Provide a forwarding address for your deposit return

**If you do not leave:**

Your landlord can apply to the court for a possession order. The court will:
- Send you a court summons
- Set a date for a hearing
- Allow you to present your case

At the hearing, if the landlord has met all legal requirements, the court will normally grant possession.

The court may give you additional time (usually 14-42 days) to leave.

If you still don't leave after a court order, your landlord can apply for bailiffs to evict you. This will add significant costs to the amount you owe.

### Help with housing costs

If you are on a low income, you may be entitled to:

**Universal Credit (including help with housing costs):**
- Apply at: www.gov.uk/universal-credit

**Housing Benefit:**
- Contact your local council

**Discretionary Housing Payment:**
- Contact your local council for extra help with housing costs

### Illegal eviction

**Your landlord CANNOT:**
- Force you to leave without a court order
- Change the locks
- Remove your belongings
- Harass or threaten you
- Cut off utilities

**This is illegal and is a criminal offence.** If your landlord does any of these things, call the police immediately and contact Shelter or Citizens Advice.

### Your rights

You have the right to:
- Stay in the property until the date in this notice (or longer if the court orders)
- Defend any court proceedings
- Be represented at court (free legal aid may be available)
- Apply to suspend or delay any possession order
- Claim compensation if your landlord has not protected your deposit
