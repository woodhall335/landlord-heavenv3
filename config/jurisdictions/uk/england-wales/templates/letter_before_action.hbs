{{/if}}

---

## WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T COMPLY

If you do not comply with the requirements above by {{final_deadline}}, we will take the following action **without further warning**:

### 1. Court Proceedings for Possession

We will issue court proceedings to seek:
- A possession order (eviction)
- {{#if rent_arrears}}A money judgment for arrears of £{{arrears_amount}}{{/if}}
- Payment of ongoing rent (mesne profits)
- Court costs and legal fees

### 2. Costs

If we have to go to court, you will be liable for:
- **Court fee:** £355
- **Legal costs:** £1,000-£3,000 (estimated)
- **Bailiff costs:** £130 (if enforcement needed)
- **Interest on arrears:** {{interest_rate}}% per annum
- **Total estimated:** £{{estimated_total_costs}}

These costs will be added to any rent arrears and claimed against you.

### 3. Credit Rating

A County Court Judgment (CCJ) will seriously damage your credit rating, making it difficult to:
- Rent another property
- Obtain credit or loans
- Get a mortgage
- Pass employment checks

### 4. Eviction

If the court grants possession, you will be evicted. You may be made homeless and the local council may decide you made yourself intentionally homeless, meaning they will not have a duty to rehouse you.

### 5. Future References

You will find it very difficult to rent another property with an eviction and CCJ on your record.
