<h2>LETTER OF CLAIM — UNPAID RENT AND ARREARS</h2>

<p>Dear {{tenant_full_name}},</p>

<h3>Re: Property at {{property_address}}</h3>

<p>
I am writing to you about the money you owe me in respect of the above property. This letter is sent in accordance with the <strong>Pre-Action Protocol for Debt Claims</strong>. You should read this letter carefully as it explains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much you owe;</li>
  <li>What the debt is for;</li>
  <li>How I have calculated the amount;</li>
  <li>What you should do next;</li>
  <li>What will happen if you do not pay or respond.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Summary of the Debt</h3>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Rent arrears:</strong></td>
    <td align="right">{{currency arrears_total}}</td>
  </tr>
  {{#if damages_total}}
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Property damage / other costs:</strong></td>
    <td align="right">{{currency damages_total}}</td>
  </tr>
  {{/if}}
  {{#if other_total}}
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Other charges:</strong></td>
    <td align="right">{{currency other_total}}</td>
  </tr>
  {{/if}}
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Interest to date ({{interest_rate}}% per annum):</strong></td>
    <td align="right">{{currency interest_to_date}}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0;">
    <td><strong>TOTAL AMOUNT OWED:</strong></td>
    <td align="right"><strong>{{currency total_claim_amount}}</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><em>Interest continues to accrue at {{currency daily_interest}} per day until the debt is paid in full.</em></p>

<h3>2. Breakdown of the Debt</h3>

<h4>Rent Arrears</h4>
<p>
You occupy the property under an assured shorthold tenancy that commenced on {{tenancy_start_date}}. The agreed rent is {{currency rent_amount}} per {{rent_frequency}}, payable in advance.
</p>

<p>
You have failed to pay rent as it fell due. The arrears have accumulated over multiple rent periods. A detailed schedule showing each period, the amount due, what you paid, and the balance is attached as <strong>Appendix 1</strong>.
</p>

{{#if damage_items.length}}
<h4>Property Damage and Other Costs</h4>
<p>In addition to rent arrears, you are liable for the following:</p>
<ul>
  {{#each damage_items}}
  <li>{{description}} — {{currency amount}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
{{/if}}

{{#if other_charges.length}}
<h4>Other Recoverable Charges</h4>
<ul>
  {{#each other_charges}}
  <li>{{description}} — {{currency amount}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
{{/if}}

<h4>Interest</h4>
<p>
I am entitled to claim interest on the outstanding rent and costs pursuant to <strong>section 69 of the County Courts Act 1984</strong>. Interest is calculated at {{interest_rate}}% per annum from {{interest_start_date}} and continues to accrue at {{currency daily_interest}} per day until payment.
</p>

<p>
The interest calculation to {{generation_date}} is {{currency interest_to_date}}. The full working is attached as <strong>Appendix 2</strong>.
</p>
