## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO

### 1. Check Validity

This notice may be invalid if any of the above requirements have not been met. If you believe this notice is invalid, seek legal advice immediately.

### 2. Seek Advice

Contact a solicitor or housing advice centre as soon as possible:

**Shelter Helpline:** 0808 800 4444
**Citizens Advice:** 0800 144 8848

You may be entitled to Legal Aid.

### 3. Do Not Ignore This Notice

Even if you dispute the validity of this notice, you should still seek advice and respond. Do not just ignore it.

### 4. If You Do Not Leave

If you do not leave by the date specified, I/we may apply to court for a possession order. If a valid Section 21 notice has been given and all requirements met, the court will usually grant possession without a hearing (accelerated possession procedure).

### 5. Continue Paying Rent

You must continue paying rent until you leave or a court orders otherwise. Rent arrears will not help your situation.

---

## COURT PROCEEDINGS

If you do not leave by {{earliest_possession_date}}, I/we may start court proceedings. 

The court proceedings must be started within 6 months of the date specified in this notice. After 6 months, this notice becomes invalid and a new notice must be served.

If the court is satisfied that:
- This is a valid Section 21 notice
- All statutory requirements have been met
- The correct notice period has been given

The court will make an order for possession. Under Section 21, the court does not consider whether it is reasonable - possession will be granted automatically if the requirements are met.

---

## YOUR RIGHTS

### Challenge the Notice

- The deposit was not protected correctly
- Required documents were not provided
- The notice was served in the first 4 months
- You made a complaint and retaliatory eviction protection applies
- The property requires licensing but is not licensed
- The notice period is incorrect
- The notice does not comply with legal requirements

### Request Longer to Leave

### Homeless Assistance

If you will be homeless when you leave, contact your local council's housing department. You may be entitled to homeless assistance.

## ABOLITION OF SECTION 21 ⚠️

Please note: Section 21 "no fault" evictions are being abolished under the Renters Reform Bill. Once this becomes law, Section 21 notices will no longer be valid and landlords will only be able to evict on specified grounds.

This notice remains valid under current law if served before abolition takes effect.
