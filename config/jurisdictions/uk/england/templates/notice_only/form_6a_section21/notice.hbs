  <p>You are entitled to at least two months' notice before being required to give up possession of your home. In some circumstances a longer notice period may be required.</p>

  <p>If you do not leave your home by the date given in section 2, your landlord may apply to the court for an order under Section 21(1) or (4) of the Housing Act 1988 requiring you to give up possession.</p>

  <p>If you are worried about this notice, and what you should do about it, take it immediately to <strong>Citizens Advice, a housing advice centre, a law centre or a solicitor.</strong></p>

  <p>If you are a debtor and you are in a 'breathing space', you should inform your debt advisor.</p>

  <p>If you believe you are at risk of homelessness as a result of receiving this notice, you should contact your local authority for support.</p>
