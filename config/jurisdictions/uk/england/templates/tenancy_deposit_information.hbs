## 7. CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN DEPOSIT MAY BE RETAINED

The landlord or agent may make deductions from the deposit for:

1. **Unpaid Rent**
   Any rent or other money owed under the tenancy agreement at the end of the tenancy.

2. **Damage**
   Damage to the property, furnishings or contents beyond normal wear and tear. This includes:
   - Broken items
   - Burns, cuts or stains beyond normal wear
   - Damage caused by pets
   - Holes in walls
   - Broken fixtures or fittings
   
   **Normal wear and tear is NOT covered** - this means reasonable deterioration from ordinary living.

3. **Cleaning**
   Professional cleaning costs if the property is returned in an unreasonably unclean condition compared to the check-in inventory.

4. **Missing Items**
   Replacement costs for:
   - Lost keys
   - Missing items from inventory
   - Removed fixtures or fittings

5. **Other Breaches**
   Costs arising from other breaches of the tenancy agreement.

### Evidence Required

The landlord must provide evidence of any claimed deductions:
- Check-in and check-out inventories
- Photographs
- Invoices for repairs/cleaning
- Receipts
- Expert reports if necessary

---

## 8. APPLYING FOR RELEASE OF DEPOSIT

### At End of Tenancy

Both parties should:

**Step 1:** Inspect the property together (check-out)

**Step 2:** Compare condition to check-in inventory

**Step 3:** Discuss and agree any deductions

**Step 4:** Complete deposit return form

**Step 5:** Submit agreed allocation to scheme

{{#if custodial}}
The scheme will release the deposit according to your agreement within **10 working days**.
{{else}}
The landlord will return your share within **10 working days** of agreement.
{{/if}}

---

## 9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### If You Cannot Agree

If you and the landlord cannot agree on deposit deductions:

**Step 1:** Try to negotiate
- Communicate in writing
- Exchange evidence (photos, receipts)
- Consider compromise

**Step 2:** Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

Both parties can ask the scheme to resolve the dispute using their free, impartial ADR service.

### ADR Process

1. **Either party raises a dispute** with the scheme
2. **Both parties submit evidence** (photos, inventory, receipts, statements)
3. **Independent adjudicator reviews** all evidence
4. **Decision made** (usually within 28 days)
5. **Scheme releases deposit** according to decision
6. **Decision is binding** on both parties

### ADR Service Details

**Service:** {{scheme_adr_name}}
**Contact:** {{scheme_adr_phone}}
**Email:** {{scheme_adr_email}}
**Website:** {{scheme_adr_website}}

**Cost:** FREE to both parties

**Time limit:** You must raise a dispute within {{dispute_deadline}} of the tenancy ending (or when dispute becomes apparent).

### Court Action

Alternatively, either party can take the matter to court, but this will involve:
- Court fees (approx £100-£300)
- Possible legal costs
- Longer time to resolve
- Risk of costs order

**ADR is usually quicker, cheaper and easier.**

## 13. BETTERMENT
