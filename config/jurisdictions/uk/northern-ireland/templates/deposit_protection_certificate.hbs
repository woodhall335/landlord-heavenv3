- Neither the landlord nor the tenant holds the deposit
- At the end of the tenancy:
  - If both parties agree on deductions, TDS NI will release the deposit accordingly
  - If there is a dispute, TDS NI will hold the disputed amount and use their Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) service
- The deposit is protected in a government-backed scheme

**Interest:** The scheme may pay interest on the deposit, which will be distributed at the end of the tenancy according to the allocation of the deposit.
{{/if_eq}}

{{#if_eq protection_type "Insured"}}
### Insured Scheme

**How it works:**
- The landlord holds the deposit
- The landlord has paid an insurance premium to TDS NI
- The deposit is insured for its full value
- At the end of the tenancy:
  - The landlord must return the deposit (minus agreed deductions) within 10 days
  - If there is a dispute, the landlord must hand over the disputed amount to TDS NI
- The insurance guarantees that the tenant's deposit is protected even if the landlord fails to return it

**Insurance:** Your deposit is insured for £{{deposit_amount}}.
