## WHY THIS IS SERIOUS

### Consequences of Rent Arrears

If this matter is not resolved:

1. **Notice to Quit:** We may serve a Notice to Quit requiring you to leave the property
   - Minimum 28 days' notice (for periodic tenancies)
   - Must expire on a rent day

2. **County Court Action:** We may apply to County Court for:
   - **Possession Order** (to repossess the property)
   - **Money Judgment** (for the arrears owed)

3. **Costs:** If we go to court, you may be ordered to pay:
   - Court fees (approximately £150-200)
   - Our legal costs
   - Bailiff fees (for enforcement)
   - The full arrears plus ongoing rent

4. **Credit Rating:** A County Court Judgment (CCJ) will seriously damage your credit rating for 6 years

5. **Future Tenancies:** Difficulty renting in the future (landlords check court records and credit history)

6. **Homelessness:** Risk of becoming homeless

## WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T RESPOND

### If we don't hear from you by {{response_deadline_date}}:

**Step 1: Notice to Quit**
We may serve a Notice to Quit requiring you to leave the property.
- Minimum 28 days' notice (periodic tenancies)
- Must expire on a rent day

**Step 2: County Court Application**
After the Notice to Quit period expires, we may apply to County Court for:
- **Civil Bill for Possession** (to get you evicted)
- **Money Claim** (for the arrears owed)

**Step 3: Court Hearing**
- You will be served with court papers
- You can defend the claim
- The court will hear both sides
- If we win, the court issues:
  - **Possession Order** (you must leave)
  - **Money Judgment** (you must pay arrears + costs)

**Step 4: Enforcement**
- If you don't leave voluntarily, the Enforcement of Judgments Office will enforce the possession order
- Bailiffs may remove you from the property
- You may still owe the money (arrears + costs)

### Court Costs You May Have to Pay:

| Item | Approximate Cost |
|------|------------------|
| Civil bill court fee | £150-200 |
| Our legal costs | £500-1,500 |
| Bailiff costs | £200-500 |
| **Your total liability** | **£850-2,200+ PLUS the rent arrears** |

**All of this can be avoided by contacting us now.**
