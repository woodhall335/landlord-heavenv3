      These are the Scottish Government model clauses for Private Residential Tenancies under the Private

    </p>

  <h2>1. Nature of Private Residential Tenancy</h2>
  <p>
    A Private Residential Tenancy (PRT) in Scotland is open-ended - it has no fixed term or end date. The
    tenancy continues until the tenant gives notice to leave, or the landlord successfully applies to the
    First-tier Tribunal for an eviction order based on one of the 18 grounds for eviction.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Rent</h2>
  <p>
    The Tenant agrees to pay the Rent on the days and in the manner specified in this Agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rent is payable in advance. The Landlord may only increase the rent once in any 12-month period by
    following the statutory procedure set out in the Private Housing (Tenancies) (Scotland) Act 2016.
    The Tenant has the right to refer a proposed rent increase to a Rent Officer for adjudication.
  </p>
  <p>
    {{#if rent_pressure_zone}}
    <strong>Rent Pressure Zone:</strong> This property is located within a designated Rent Pressure Zone.
    Rent increases are capped at the rate specified by the local authority.
    {{/if}}
  </p>

  <h2>3. Deposit Protection</h2>
  <p>
    If the Landlord takes a deposit, they must protect it in a Scottish Government-approved tenancy deposit
    scheme within 30 working days of the tenancy starting. The Landlord must provide prescribed information
    about the deposit protection to the Tenant.
  </p>

    the Repairing Standard.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Tenant's Obligations</h2>
  <p>
    The Tenant agrees to:

    subject to giving at least 48 hours' written notice (except in emergencies). The landlord must give
    reasonable notice before any inspection or visit.

    at least 28 days' written notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Landlord's Notice:</strong> The Landlord may only end the tenancy by serving a Notice to Leave
    based on one of the 18 statutory grounds for eviction and, if the tenant does not leave, by obtaining
    an eviction order from the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland (Housing and Property Chamber).

    the Tenant's use and enjoyment of the property without lawful excuse.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Landlord Registration</h2>
  <p>
    All private landlords in Scotland must be registered with their local authority. It is a criminal
