    <strong>⚠️ Important Notice</strong>
    This guide provides general information only. It is NOT legal advice and does not constitute a substitute for advice from a regulated solicitor or legal professional. Enforcement options depend on your specific circumstances, the defender's financial situation, and judicial decisions. Always consider taking independent legal advice before proceeding with enforcement action.
  </div>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Congratulations on obtaining your Sheriff Court decree through Simple Procedure. However, a decree alone does not automatically result in payment. If the defender does not pay voluntarily within 14 days, you will need to take <strong>diligence</strong> (enforcement action) to recover the money owed.
  </p>
  <p>
    This guide explains the main enforcement methods available in Scotland, the costs involved, and how to choose the most appropriate method based on your circumstances.

  <h2>Before You Start Diligence (Enforcement)</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3>✓ Checklist Before Enforcement</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wait at least <strong>14 days</strong> from the date the decree was granted before applying for enforcement</li>
      <li>Obtain an <strong>extract decree</strong> from the Sheriff Court - this is the official document needed for enforcement</li>
      <li>Check if the defender has applied for a time to pay order or lodged an appeal</li>
      <li>Gather information about the defender's financial circumstances (employment, assets, bank details, property)</li>
      <li>Consider whether the defender can actually pay - diligence against someone with no assets or income may not be worthwhile</li>
      <li>Be prepared to pay Sheriff Officer fees and court fees upfront</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Diligence Methods (Enforcement)</h2>
  <p>The main diligence methods available in Scotland after obtaining a decree are:</p>

  <div class="method-section">
    <h3>1. Earnings Arrestment</h3>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> An order requiring the defender's employer to deduct regular amounts from their wages and pay them directly to you.</p>

    <p><strong>When to use:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The defender is <span class="highlight">employed</span> (not self-employed)</li>
      <li>You know their employer's name and address</li>
      <li>The defender earns above the protected earnings threshold</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regular, automatic payments</li>
      <li>Relatively straightforward and cost-effective</li>
      <li>High success rate if defender is employed</li>
      <li>No need for Sheriff Officer involvement once in place</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only works for employed defenders</li>
      <li>Cannot be used if defender earns below protected threshold (approx. £529.90/month as of 2024)</li>
      <li>Defender can change jobs to avoid payment</li>
      <li>Deductions are limited based on earnings</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Minimal - you serve the schedule yourself or via Sheriff Officer (approx. £25-50 for service)</p>
    <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Complete an Earnings Arrestment Schedule and serve it on the employer</p>
  </div>

  <div class="method-section">
    <h3>2. Bank Arrestment</h3>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> An order freezing money in the defender's bank account or building society, allowing you to recover the debt from frozen funds.</p>

    <p><strong>When to use:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You know the defender <span class="highlight">has money in a bank account</span></li>
      <li>You have the name and address of the defender's bank or building society</li>
      <li>The defender has sufficient funds to cover the debt</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Very effective if defender has sufficient funds</li>
      <li>Immediate freezing of the account</li>
      <li>Can result in quick payment</li>
      <li>Can be done without going back to court</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You need to identify the bank and branch</li>
      <li>Account may have insufficient funds</li>
      <li>Certain accounts are protected (e.g., some benefit payments up to £1,000)</li>
      <li>Joint accounts can only be arrested for 50% of the balance</li>
      <li>Defender can apply to have arrestment recalled or restricted</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Sheriff Officer fees (approx. £50-100) plus bank fees (typically £25-50)</p>
    <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Instruct a Sheriff Officer to serve an Arrestment Schedule on the bank</p>
  </div>

  <div class="method-section">
    <h3>3. Attachment of Goods (Sheriff Officer and Auction)</h3>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A Sheriff Officer visits the defender's property, lists valuable items, and can later remove and sell them at auction to recover the debt.</p>

    <p><strong>When to use:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The defender has <span class="highlight">valuable possessions</span></li>
      <li>You know where the defender lives or works</li>
      <li>Other methods have failed or are not suitable</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can be very effective if defender has valuable goods</li>
      <li>Defender may pay to avoid auction</li>
      <li>Sheriff Officer handles the process</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Many defenders have few or no valuable possessions</li>
      <li>Certain items cannot be attached (essential household items, tools of trade up to £1,000 value, items on HP/finance)</li>
      <li>Defender can hide or remove goods before auction</li>
      <li>Auction proceeds may be less than expected</li>
      <li>High Sheriff Officer fees</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Sheriff Officer fees for initial visit (£100-150), attachment report (£150-250), and auction (varies, can be £500+)</p>
    <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Instruct a Sheriff Officer to execute an Attachment</p>
  </div>

  <div class="method-section">
    <h3>4. Inhibition (Land and Property)</h3>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> An order recorded against the defender in the Register of Inhibitions, preventing them from selling or borrowing against heritable property (land/buildings) without settling your debt first.</p>

    <p><strong>When to use:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The defender <span class="highlight">owns property or land</span></li>
      <li>The debt is substantial (£1,000+)</li>
      <li>You are prepared to wait for payment until the property is sold or remortgaged</li>
      <li>You want to prevent the defender from selling assets</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Secures the debt against heritable property</li>
      <li>Prevents defender from selling or borrowing without paying you</li>
      <li>Shows the defender you are serious about enforcement</li>
      <li>Lasts for 5 years and can be renewed</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does not give you immediate payment</li>
      <li>Can take years before you receive payment</li>
      <li>Property may have existing securities with priority</li>
      <li>Requires additional steps (land attachment) to force sale</li>
      <li>Court fee and registration fees apply</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Sheriff Officer fees (approx. £50-100) plus Register of Inhibitions fee (£20)</p>
    <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Instruct a Sheriff Officer to serve a Schedule of Inhibition</p>
  </div>

  <div class="method-section">
    <h3>5. Money Attachment (Business Cash)</h3>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> An order allowing a Sheriff Officer to seize cash found at the defender's business premises.</p>

    <p><strong>When to use:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The defender operates a <span class="highlight">cash business</span></li>
      <li>You believe they have significant cash on premises</li>
      <li>Other methods have failed</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediate recovery of cash</li>
      <li>Effective for cash businesses</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rarely successful - most businesses use electronic payments</li>
      <li>Limited to cash actually found on premises at time of visit</li>
      <li>Defender can avoid by keeping cash elsewhere</li>
      <li>High Sheriff Officer fees</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Sheriff Officer fees (approx. £100-200)</p>
    <p><strong>How to apply:</strong> Instruct a Sheriff Officer to execute a Money Attachment</p>
  </div>

  <div class="method-section">
    <h3>6. Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) and Sequestration Considerations</h3>
    <p><strong>What they are:</strong> Formal debt solutions that may affect your enforcement options.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS):</strong> If the defender enters a DAS (Debt Payment Programme), all diligence is frozen and you receive scheduled payments through the scheme</li>
      <li><strong>Sequestration (Bankruptcy):</strong> If the defender is sequestrated, most diligence stops and you become an ordinary creditor in the sequestration</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Be aware that defenders can use these mechanisms to avoid enforcement. However, you will still be included in the payment plan or bankruptcy distribution.</p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <strong>💡 Sheriff Officer Fees</strong>
    <p>Sheriff Officer fees are regulated but can vary. Always obtain a quote before instructing diligence. Fees are typically added to the debt and recovered from the defender if enforcement is successful.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>How to Choose the Right Diligence Method</h2>
  <ol class="steps-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Assess the defender's situation</strong><br>
      Do they have a job? Property? Bank accounts? Assets? Start with the most straightforward method based on what you know.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Start with low-cost methods</strong><br>
      Earnings Arrestment (if employed) or Bank Arrestment (if you know their bank) are usually the best first steps.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consider the debt amount</strong><br>
      For smaller debts (under £1,000), avoid expensive diligence like Attachment of Goods. For larger debts, Inhibition may be worthwhile even if payment is delayed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Evaluate likelihood of success</strong><br>
      Don't spend money on diligence if the defender has no assets, income, or ability to pay.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use multiple methods if necessary</strong><br>
      You can combine methods - e.g., Earnings Arrestment for ongoing recovery plus Inhibition to secure against property.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3>Recommended Action Plan</h3>
    <p>Based on your decree for <strong>£{{total_claim_amount}}</strong> against {{tenant_full_name}}:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Obtain an extract decree</strong> from the Sheriff Court (essential for all diligence)</li>
      <li><strong>Wait 14 days</strong> from decree to allow voluntary payment</li>
      <li><strong>Send a final demand letter</strong> warning of diligence</li>
      <li><strong>Choose appropriate diligence:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If employed: Earnings Arrestment</li>
          <li>If you know their bank: Bank Arrestment</li>
          <li>If they own property: Inhibition (for security)</li>
          <li>If they have valuable goods: Attachment</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Instruct a Sheriff Officer</strong> to execute the diligence</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor and follow up:</strong> Be prepared to try alternative methods if needed</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h2>Important Warnings</h2>
  <div class="warning-box">
    <strong>⚠️ Do Not Take Direct Action</strong>
    You must not harass, threaten, or take the law into your own hands. Always use official diligence procedures through Sheriff Officers and the court. Harassment can result in criminal charges.
  </div>

  <div class="warning-box">
    <strong>⚠️ Debt Arrangement and Bankruptcy</strong>
    If the defender enters a Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) or is sequestrated (bankrupt), all diligence is frozen or stopped. You will become an ordinary creditor and may only receive a small portion of the debt owed.
