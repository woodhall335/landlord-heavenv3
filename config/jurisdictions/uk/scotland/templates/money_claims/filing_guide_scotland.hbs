<h2>What is Simple Procedure?</h2>

<p>
<strong>Simple Procedure</strong> is Scotland's streamlined court process for civil claims up to <strong>£5,000</strong>. It replaced Small Claims in 2016 and is designed to be accessible without needing a solicitor.
</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>✅ <strong>Lower costs:</strong> Court fees range from £21 to £145</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Informal hearings:</strong> The sheriff manages the case and helps both parties</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>No need for a solicitor:</strong> You can represent yourself (known as a "party litigant")</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Faster resolution:</strong> Most cases are decided within 3-6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>⚠️ IMPORTANT:</strong> If your claim exceeds £5,000, you must raise an Ordinary Cause action instead. Seek legal advice.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Before You Lodge Your Claim</h2>

<h3>✅ Checklist: Have you completed these steps?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>☐ <strong>Attempted to resolve the dispute</strong> with the defender (defendant)</li>
  <li>☐ <strong>Sent a Pre-Action Letter</strong> giving the defender at least 14 days to pay or respond</li>
  <li>☐ <strong>Waited for the deadline</strong> to pass without payment or satisfactory response</li>
  <li>☐ <strong>Gathered all supporting evidence:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Tenancy agreement</li>
      <li>Rent payment records / bank statements</li>
      <li>Demand letters / correspondence</li>
      <li>Photos of property damage (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Repair quotes / invoices (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>☐ <strong>Calculated the claim amount correctly</strong> (principal + interest)</li>
  <li>☐ <strong>Identified the correct Sheriff Court</strong> based on the defender's address</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>⚠️ IMPORTANT:</strong> Simple Procedure Rule 3.1 requires you to make a reasonable attempt to resolve the dispute before raising a claim. The sheriff may dismiss your claim or award expenses against you if you have not followed this rule.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Which Sheriff Court Should You Use?</h2>

<p>
Simple Procedure claims must be raised in the Sheriff Court covering the area where the <strong>defender (defendant) lives</strong>.
</p>

<p>Based on the defender's address ({{property_address}}), the correct Sheriff Court is:</p>

<blockquote style="background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 10px;">
<strong>{{sheriffdom}}</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you are unsure which Sheriff Court has jurisdiction, check the <a href="https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/the-courts/sheriff-court/find-your-local-court">Scottish Courts website</a> or telephone the Sheriff Clerk at your nearest Sheriff Court.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>How Much is the Court Fee?</h2>

<p>
Your claim amount is <strong>{{currency total_claim_amount}}</strong>, so the court fee is <strong>{{currency court_fee}}</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Simple Procedure court fees are based on the claim value:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0;">
    <th>Claim Amount</th>
    <th>Court Fee</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>Up to £300</td><td>£21</td></tr>
  <tr><td>£300.01 to £1,500</td><td>£75</td></tr>
  <tr><td>£1,500.01 to £5,000</td><td>£145</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If the defender admits the claim or you obtain decree (judgment) in your favour, you can usually recover the court fee as part of your expenses.
</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step: Lodging Your Simple Procedure Claim</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Complete the Simple Procedure Claim Form (Form 3A)</h3>

<p>
This pack includes a <strong>completed Form 3A</strong> (Simple Procedure Claim Form) with all your details pre-filled. You should:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Print <strong>two copies</strong> of the form (one for the court, one for your records)</li>
  <li>Check that all the details are correct</li>
  <li>Sign and date the Statement of Truth at the end of the form</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>⚠️ DO NOT alter the form layout or add extra pages to the official form.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare Supporting Documents</h3>

<p>
You must attach the following documents to your claim form in this order:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Statement of Claim (Particulars)</strong> — Explains the background to the claim and what you are seeking</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule of Rent Arrears</strong> — Period-by-period breakdown of unpaid rent</li>
  <li><strong>Interest Calculation</strong> — Shows how you calculated the interest (if claiming interest)</li>
  <li><strong>Evidence Index</strong> — List of all supporting documents</li>
  <li><strong>Copy of tenancy agreement</strong> — Showing the agreed rent and payment terms</li>
  <li><strong>Rent payment records</strong> — Bank statements, rent ledger, or receipts</li>
  <li><strong>Demand letters</strong> — Pre-Action Letter and any other demands sent to the defender</li>
  {{#if damage_items.length}}
  <li><strong>Photos of property damage</strong> — If claiming for damage beyond normal wear and tear</li>
  <li><strong>Repair quotes / invoices</strong> — Supporting your damage claim</li>
  {{/if}}
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Number each document and cross-reference it in your Statement of Claim (e.g., "see Production 1 — Tenancy Agreement").
</p>

<p>
<strong>Presentation:</strong> Use a treasury tag or binding (top left corner). Do not use paperclips or staples, as the court may need to copy the documents.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Calculate the Total Amount to Lodge</h3>

<p>You need to pay the court fee when you lodge your claim:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="60%"><strong>Court fee:</strong></td>
    <td width="40%">{{currency court_fee}}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
You can pay by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cash</strong> (in person only)</li>
  <li><strong>Cheque</strong> — Made payable to "Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service"</li>
  <li><strong>Postal order</strong> — Payable to "Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service"</li>
  <li><strong>Debit / credit card</strong> (in person or by telephone in some courts)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Check with your Sheriff Court</strong> which payment methods they accept before attending.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Lodge Your Claim</h3>

<p>
You can lodge your claim <strong>in person</strong> or <strong>by post</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Option A: Lodge in Person (Recommended)</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Take your completed claim form, supporting documents, and payment to:
    <blockquote style="background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 10px;">
      <strong>{{sheriffdom}}</strong><br>
      [Insert court address here]
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Go to the <strong>Sheriff Clerk's office</strong> and tell them you wish to lodge a Simple Procedure claim.</li>
  <li>The clerk will:
    <ul>
      <li>Check your form</li>
      <li>Allocate a case reference number</li>
      <li>Take payment of the court fee</li>
      <li>Issue you with a receipt and a copy of the stamped claim form</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keep the receipt and stamped copy for your records.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Advantages of lodging in person:</strong> The clerk can check your form immediately and help with any errors. You will get your case reference number straight away.
</p>

<h4>Option B: Lodge by Post</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Send your claim form, supporting documents, and payment (cheque or postal order) to:
    <blockquote style="background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 10px;">
      <strong>Sheriff Clerk</strong><br>
      {{sheriffdom}}<br>
      [Insert court address here]
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Include a covering letter stating:
    <ul>
      <li>"I enclose a Simple Procedure Claim Form (Form 3A) and supporting documents."</li>
      <li>"I enclose a cheque/postal order for £{{court_fee}} in payment of the court fee."</li>
      <li>"Please acknowledge receipt and provide the case reference number."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Send by <strong>recorded delivery</strong> or <strong>special delivery</strong> to prove posting.</li>
  <li>Keep copies of everything you send.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Postal lodgments may take 5-10 working days to process. You will receive written confirmation by post.
</p>

<h3>Step 5: The Court Will Serve the Claim</h3>

<p>
Once your claim is lodged, the Sheriff Clerk will:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Register your claim and allocate a case reference number (e.g., A123/25)</li>
  <li><strong>Serve</strong> the claim form and supporting documents on the defender by <strong>recorded delivery post</strong></li>
  <li>Send you a <strong>Service Certificate</strong> confirming the date the claim was posted to the defender</li>
</ol>

<p>
The defender has <strong>21 days</strong> from the date the claim is served to respond.
</p>

<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>

<h3>Timeline After Claim is Served</h3>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr style="background-color: #f0f0f0;">
    <th width="20%">Day</th>
    <th width="80%">What Happens</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Day 0</strong></td>
    <td>Claim is served on the defender by recorded delivery post</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Day 21</strong></td>
    <td>Defender's deadline to lodge a Response Form (Form 4A)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Day 22+</strong></td>
    <td>If defender does not respond, you can request <strong>decree by default</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Day 28+</strong></td>
    <td>If defender responds, the sheriff will decide next steps (hearing, written submissions, or decree)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Possible Outcomes</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Defender pays in full</strong> — You notify the court and the case is closed.</li>
  <li><strong>Defender does not respond</strong> — You apply for decree by default (automatic judgment in your favour).</li>
  <li><strong>Defender admits the claim but asks to pay by installments</strong> — The sheriff will decide what is reasonable.</li>
  <li><strong>Defender disputes the claim</strong> — The sheriff will hold a hearing (usually informal) and make a decision based on the evidence.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>If the Defender Does Not Respond (Decree by Default)</h2>

<p>
If the defender does not lodge a Response Form within 21 days, you can apply for <strong>decree by default</strong>. This means the sheriff will grant judgment in your favour without a hearing.
</p>

<h3>How to Apply for Decree by Default:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Wait until the 21-day response period has expired.</li>
  <li>Write to the Sheriff Clerk stating:
    <blockquote>
    "I am the claimant in case [case reference number]. The defender has not lodged a response within the prescribed period. I respectfully request that the sheriff grant decree by default in terms of the sum claimed, namely {{currency total_claim_amount}} plus court fee of {{currency court_fee}} and expenses."
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>The sheriff will review the file and, if satisfied, grant decree (usually within 7-14 days).</li>
  <li>You will receive a <strong>certified copy of the decree</strong> by post.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>After You Get Decree (Judgment)</h2>

<p>
If the defender does not pay voluntarily after decree is granted, you can enforce the judgment using:
</p>

<h3>Enforcement Options (Diligence) in Scotland:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Charge for Payment</strong> — A formal demand giving the defender 14 days to pay before further diligence</li>
  <li><strong>Earnings Arrestment</strong> — Deduct money from the defender's wages</li>
  <li><strong>Bank Arrestment</strong> — Freeze money in the defender's bank account</li>
  <li><strong>Attachment</strong> — Seize and sell the defender's belongings (via sheriff officers)</li>
  <li><strong>Inhibition</strong> — Prevent the defender from selling property they own</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> You must first serve a <strong>Charge for Payment</strong> before using any other enforcement method (except inhibition).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sheriff Officers:</strong> Most enforcement requires instructing sheriff officers (the Scottish equivalent of bailiffs). You will need to pay their fees upfront, but you can recover these from the defender if enforcement is successful.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Do You Need a Solicitor?</h2>

<p>
<strong>No.</strong> Simple Procedure is designed so you can represent yourself without a solicitor.
</p>

<p>
However, you may wish to instruct a solicitor if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The defender lodges a complex defence;</li>
  <li>The claim involves legal arguments (e.g., interpretation of the tenancy agreement);</li>
  <li>You are not confident presenting your case at a hearing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you do instruct a solicitor, <strong>you may be able to recover their fees as expenses</strong> if you win, but this is not guaranteed. Check with your solicitor first.

<h2>Important Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Interest continues:</strong> If you are claiming interest, it continues to accrue until payment. Update your claim amount at the hearing if needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep records:</strong> Keep copies of all documents, correspondence, and court orders. You may need them for enforcement.</li>
  <li><strong>Attend hearings:</strong> If the sheriff sets a hearing date, you <strong>must</strong> attend. If you do not, your claim may be dismissed.</li>
  <li><strong>Be prepared:</strong> Bring all your evidence to the hearing in a logical order. The sheriff will ask you questions.</li>
