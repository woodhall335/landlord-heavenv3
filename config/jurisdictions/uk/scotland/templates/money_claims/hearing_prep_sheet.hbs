        Make sure anything lodged with the court is also provided to the defender, unless the rules say otherwise.

    <h2>4. Your Story in 60 Seconds</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Use this as a structure when the Sheriff asks you to explain the case:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Who you are &amp; what this is:</strong><br />
          “I am the landlord of {{property_address}}{{#if property_postcode}}, {{property_postcode}}{{/if}}.
          This is a Simple Procedure claim for unpaid rent{{#if damages_total}} and related damages{{/if}}.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The tenancy &amp; rent:</strong><br />
          Briefly state when the tenancy started, the rent amount and how often it was due
          (for example, £{{rent_amount}} {{rent_frequency}}).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What went wrong:</strong><br />
          Explain when the arrears started and how they built up. Refer to your arrears schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pre-action steps under Rule 3.1:</strong><br />
          Say when you first wrote to the defender, any reminders, and how long you gave them to respond.
          {{#if pre_action_summary}}
            <br />Summary of steps recorded in your pack: {{pre_action_summary}}
          {{/if}}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What you are asking the court for:</strong><br />
          A decision (decree) for the total arrears, any proven damages/charges, interest and expenses.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Likely Questions from the Sheriff</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Common questions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Please take me to the tenancy agreement – what are the key terms on rent and payment?”</li>
        <li>“How have you calculated the arrears figure shown in your claim?”</li>
        <li>“What steps did you take to comply with the pre-action requirements?”</li>
        <li>“Have there been any discussions about a repayment plan?”</li>
        <li>“Are there any issues of disrepair that might affect rent liability?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Answer clearly and briefly, and always refer back to documents (tenancy, rent schedule,
        pre-action letters and correspondence).
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>6. Risks &amp; Red Flags to Be Aware Of</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>
        The Sheriff will look at the whole history of the tenancy and your pre-action steps.
        Your claim may be weakened if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your arrears schedule is inconsistent with payments shown in bank statements.</li>
        <li>You did not give the defender a fair chance to respond before raising proceedings.</li>
        <li>There are ongoing disrepair allegations you have not addressed.</li>
        <li>You have included charges that are not permitted under the tenancy terms or law.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted small">

      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>7. On the Day of the Case</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li>Arrive early and bring at least two copies of your bundle (one for you, one spare).</li>
        <li>Have your tenancy agreement and arrears schedule at the front of the bundle.</li>
        <li>Make notes of key dates: tenancy start, arrears start, dates of pre-action letters, claim raised date.</li>
        <li>Address the Sheriff respectfully and speak slowly.</li>
        <li>Answer questions directly; if you do not know something, say so honestly.</li>
      </ul>
