<h1>Interest Calculation</h1>

<p><strong>Principal claimed:</strong> {{currency total_principal}}</p>
<p><strong>Interest rate:</strong> {{interest_rate}}% per annum (statutory rate)</p>
<p><strong>Accrued interest to {{generation_date}}:</strong> {{currency interest_to_date}}</p>
<p><strong>Daily rate:</strong> {{currency daily_interest}} ({{interest_rate}}% / 365)</p>

<h2>Working</h2>
<p>
  Daily rate calculation: ({{currency total_principal}} × {{interest_rate}}%) / 365 = {{currency daily_interest}}
</p>
<p>
  Interest claimed to date of claim: {{currency daily_interest}} × {{days_accrued}} days = {{currency interest_to_date}}
  {{#if interest_start_date}} starting from {{interest_start_date}}{{/if}}.
</p>

<h2>Legal basis</h2>
<p>
  Interest is claimed under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 or at common law.
  The Pursuer is entitled to interest on the principal debt from the date the debt became due until payment is made in full.
</p>

<p>
  The daily rate continues to apply until decree is granted and payment is made. Update this calculation
  if the claim is lodged after {{generation_date}}.
