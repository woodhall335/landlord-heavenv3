<h2>Important: Attempt to Resolve First</h2>

<p><strong>⚠️ DO NOT lodge the claim immediately.</strong> Simple Procedure Rule 3.1 requires you to attempt to resolve the dispute before raising court proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>You MUST first:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Send the <strong>Pre-Action Letter</strong> to the defender by recorded delivery post or email</li>
  <li>Give the defender at least <strong>14 days</strong> to respond or pay</li>
  <li>Consider any reasonable payment plan proposals</li>
  <li>Keep proof of sending and copies of all correspondence</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you do not make a reasonable attempt to resolve the matter before raising proceedings, the sheriff may:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dismiss your claim</li>
  <li>Find you liable for the defender's expenses</li>
  <li>Award reduced expenses even if you win</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Only proceed to court if:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The defender does not respond within 14 days, OR</li>
  <li>The defender refuses to pay or make reasonable payment arrangements, OR</li>
  <li>You genuinely cannot reach agreement despite good faith efforts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lodging steps (after pre-action period)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Print the Simple Procedure Claim Form (Form 3A) on white A4. Do not alter the form layout.</li>
  <li>Attach the particulars, arrears schedule, interest sheet and evidence index.</li>
  <li>Gather supporting evidence (tenancy agreement, rent payment records, demand letters, photos, invoices).</li>
  <li>Lodge the bundle at <strong>{{sheriffdom}}</strong> in person or by post.</li>
  <li>Pay the court fee ({{currency court_fee}}) by cash, cheque, postal order, or card.</li>
  <li>Include proof that you sent the Pre-Action Letter and attempted to resolve the dispute.</li>
  <li>The Sheriff Clerk will serve the claim on the defender by recorded delivery post.</li>
</ol>
