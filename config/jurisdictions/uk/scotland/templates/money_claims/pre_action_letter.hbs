<h2>FORMAL DEMAND FOR PAYMENT OF RENT ARREARS</h2>

<p>Dear {{tenant_full_name}},</p>

<h3>Re: Property at {{property_address}}</h3>

I am writing to you about the money you owe me in respect of rent and other sums relating to the above property.
</p>

<p>
<strong>This is a final demand for payment before I raise court proceedings against you.</strong> You should read this letter carefully and seek advice if you are unsure what to do.

<p><em>Interest continues to accrue at {{currency daily_interest}} per day until the debt is paid in full.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Background to the Debt</h2>

<h3>The Tenancy</h3>
<p>
You occupy (or occupied) the above property under a private residential tenancy that commenced on {{tenancy_start_date}}. The agreed rent was {{currency rent_amount}} per {{rent_frequency}}, payable in advance{{#if payment_day}} on day {{payment_day}} of each period{{/if}}.
</p>

{{#if tenancy_end_date}}
<p>The tenancy ended on {{tenancy_end_date}}.</p>
{{else}}
<p>The tenancy is ongoing.</p>
{{/if}}

<h3>Rent Arrears</h3>
<p>
You have failed to pay rent as it fell due under the tenancy agreement. The arrears have accumulated over multiple rent periods.
</p>

<p>
A detailed schedule showing each rent period, the amount due, what you paid, and the outstanding balance is attached as <strong>Appendix 1: Schedule of Rent Arrears</strong>.
</p>

<p>
As at {{generation_date}}, the total rent arrears amount to <strong>{{currency arrears_total}}</strong>.
</p>

{{#if damage_items.length}}
<h3>Property Damage and Other Costs</h3>
<p>In addition to rent arrears, you are liable for the following costs:</p>
<ul>
  {{#each damage_items}}
  <li>{{description}} — {{currency amount}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
<p>
These costs relate to damage you caused to the property beyond normal wear and tear, or other sums you owe under the tenancy agreement.
</p>
{{/if}}

{{#if other_charges.length}}
<h3>Other Recoverable Charges</h3>
<ul>
  {{#each other_charges}}
  <li>{{description}} — {{currency amount}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
{{/if}}

<h3>Interest</h3>
<p>
I am entitled to claim interest on the outstanding arrears and costs. Interest is calculated at {{interest_rate}}% per annum from {{interest_start_date}} and continues to accrue at {{currency daily_interest}} per day until payment is made in full.
</p>

<p>
The interest calculated to {{generation_date}} is {{currency interest_to_date}}. The full calculation is attached as <strong>Appendix 2: Interest Calculation</strong>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Previous Attempts to Resolve This Matter</h2>

<p>
{{#if attempts_to_resolve}}
{{attempts_to_resolve}}
{{else}}
I have previously contacted you to request payment of the arrears. Specifically:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>I sent you a written demand for payment on {{demand_letter_date}} requesting full payment within 14 days. You did not respond or pay.</li>
  <li>I sent you a further demand on {{second_demand_date}} offering you the opportunity to arrange a payment plan. Again, you did not respond.</li>
  <li>I have attempted to contact you by telephone and email but you have not engaged with me to resolve this matter.</li>
</ul>

<p>
{{/if}}
</p>

<p>
Despite my efforts to resolve this matter without court proceedings, you have failed to pay the arrears or make acceptable arrangements to clear the debt.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. What You Must Do Now</h2>

<p>
You have <strong>14 days from the date of this letter</strong> (i.e., until {{response_deadline}}) to do ONE of the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Pay the full amount owed</strong> ({{currency total_claim_amount}}) to avoid court proceedings.</li>
  <li><strong>Contact me immediately</strong> to discuss a realistic payment arrangement.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide a written explanation</strong> if you dispute the debt, along with supporting evidence.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to Pay</h3>

<p>If you wish to pay the debt in full, please arrange payment by bank transfer to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Account name: {{landlord_full_name}}</li>
  <li>Sort code: [INSERT SORT CODE]</li>
  <li>Account number: [INSERT ACCOUNT NUMBER]</li>
  <li>Payment reference: {{property_postcode}} ARREARS</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, contact me at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Telephone: {{landlord_phone}}</li>
  <li>Email: {{landlord_email}}</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payment Plans</h3>

<p>
If you cannot pay the full amount immediately but can make regular payments, I may be willing to accept a payment arrangement. However, any payment plan must:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clear the arrears within a reasonable period (typically 6-12 months);</li>
  <li>Include ongoing rent payments in full (if you still occupy the property);</li>
  <li>Be realistic based on your financial circumstances;</li>
  <li>Be confirmed in writing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You must contact me within 14 days to propose a payment plan, supported by details of your income and expenditure.

<h2>6. What Happens If You Do Not Respond or Pay</h2>

<p>
If you do not pay the debt or contact me within 14 days to make acceptable arrangements, I will have no choice but to raise Simple Procedure proceedings against you in the Sheriff Court <strong>without further warning</strong>.
</p>

<h3>If I Raise Court Proceedings:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The claim will be for the full amount owed ({{currency total_claim_amount}}) <strong>plus court expenses</strong>.</li>
  <li>The Sheriff Court will send you a Simple Procedure Claim Form by recorded delivery.</li>
  <li>You will have to respond within the deadline set by the court (usually 21 days).</li>
  <li>If you do not respond or defend the claim, the sheriff will grant decree (judgment) against you in my favour.</li>
  <li>You will be ordered to pay:
    <ul>
      <li>The full debt ({{currency total_claim_amount}})</li>
      <li>Court fee ({{currency court_fee}})</li>
      <li>My legal expenses (if I instruct a solicitor)</li>
      <li>Interest continuing to accrue at {{currency daily_interest}} per day</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A court decree will damage your credit rating for six years, making it difficult to get loans, mortgages, or credit.</li>
  <li>I can enforce the decree by:
    <ul>
      <li>Instructing sheriff officers to seize and sell your belongings</li>
      <li>Applying for an earnings arrestment to deduct money from your wages</li>
      <li>Freezing your bank account through a bank arrestment</li>
      <li>Placing an inhibition on any property you own</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Court proceedings will be expensive and stressful for you. It is in your best interests to resolve this matter now.</strong>
