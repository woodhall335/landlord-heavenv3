IMPORTANT NOTES FOR WALES:

1. Rent Smart Wales is MANDATORY. If you are not registered, register
   immediately at rentsmartswales.gov.wales before serving any notice.

2. The Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 uses different terminology:
   - "Contract-holder" instead of "tenant"
   - "Occupation contract" instead of "tenancy agreement"
   - "Written statement" instead of "tenancy agreement" for document

3. Section 173 (no-fault) notices in Wales require:
   - Rent Smart Wales registration
   - 6 months minimum notice
   - Cannot be served in first 6 months
   - Written statement must have been provided

4. Prescribed forms for Wales begin with "RHW" (Renting Homes Wales):
   - RHW16: Section 173 notice (standard occupation contracts, 6 months minimum notice)
   - RHW23: Notice before possession claim (fault-based grounds)

5. Courts in Wales will strictly check Rent Smart Wales compliance.
   Bring your registration confirmation to any hearing.

==================================================================

NEXT STEPS:

1. Address all CRITICAL ACTIONS listed above (if any)
2. Ensure Rent Smart Wales registration is current
3. Gather evidence of compliance (certificates, written statement, deposits)
4. Use correct Welsh prescribed notice forms (RHW series)
5. Serve notice only when fully compliant
6. Keep detailed records of all communications and actions
