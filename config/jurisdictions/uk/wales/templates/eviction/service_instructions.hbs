## 2. METHODS OF SERVICE

Under Welsh law, you can serve a notice by:

### Option 1: Personal Service (RECOMMENDED)
- Hand the notice directly to the contract-holder
- Get them to sign a copy confirming receipt
- If they refuse to sign, have a witness present

### Option 2: Leaving at the Dwelling
- Leave the notice at the dwelling in a sealed envelope
- Address it to the contract-holder
- Put it through the letterbox or hand it to an adult at the property

### Option 3: Postal Service
- Send by First Class post to the dwelling address
- **RECOMMENDED:** Use Royal Mail Signed For or Special Delivery
- Keep proof of postage (certificate of posting or tracking number)
- Notice is deemed served when it would be delivered in ordinary course of post (usually 2 working days)

### Option 4: Email (Only If Agreed in Contract)
- Can only use email if the contract specifically allows it
- Keep a copy of the sent email and any read receipts
- Follow up with postal or personal service to be safe
