    <h2>4. Your Story in 60 Seconds</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Use this as a structure when the Judge asks you to explain the case:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Who you are &amp; what this is:</strong><br />
          "I am the landlord of {{property_address}}{{#if property_postcode}}, {{property_postcode}}{{/if}}.
          I am bringing a money claim for unpaid rent{{#if damages_total}} and related damages{{/if}}."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The occupation contract &amp; rent:</strong><br />
          Briefly state when the contract started, the rent amount and how often it was due
          (for example, £{{rent_amount}} {{rent_frequency}}).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What went wrong:</strong><br />
          Explain when the arrears started and how they built up. Refer the Judge to your arrears schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What you did before issuing the claim:</strong><br />
          Mention your Letters Before Claim and any attempts to agree a payment plan.
          {{#if pre_action_summary}}
            <br />Summary of steps recorded in your pack: {{pre_action_summary}}
          {{/if}}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What you are asking the court for:</strong><br />
          A money judgment for the total arrears, any proven damages/charges, interest and the court fee.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Likely Questions the Judge May Ask</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Common questions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Please take me to the written statement. When did it start and what is the rent?"</li>
        <li>"How have you calculated the arrears figure shown in your claim?"</li>
        <li>"Did you give the contract-holder a fair opportunity to pay before issuing proceedings?"</li>
        <li>"Have there been any housing benefit / universal credit delays or disputes?"</li>
        <li>"Have the parties tried to agree a payment plan or settlement?"</li>
        <li>"Are you registered with Rent Smart Wales?" (if relevant)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Answer clearly and briefly, and always refer back to the documents in your bundle (written statement,
        rent schedule, letters and emails).
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>6. Risks &amp; Red Flags to Be Aware Of</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p>
        The court will normally grant judgment where the arrears are clearly proven and the
        pre-action steps are reasonable. However, your claim may be weakened if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your arrears schedule does not match bank statements or rent records.</li>
        <li>You have not given the contract-holder a realistic deadline to respond before issuing.</li>
        <li>There are disputes about disrepair that you have not addressed.</li>
        <li>You have included charges the occupation contract does not allow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted small">

    </div>

    <h2>7. On the Day of the Hearing</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li>Arrive early and bring at least two copies of your bundle (one for you, one spare).</li>
        <li>Have your written statement and arrears schedule at the front of the bundle.</li>
        <li>Make notes of key dates: contract start, arrears start, dates of demand letters, claim issue date.</li>
        <li>Address the Judge as "Sir", "Madam" or "Judge" and speak slowly.</li>
        <li>Answer questions directly; if you do not know something, say so honestly.</li>
      </ul>
