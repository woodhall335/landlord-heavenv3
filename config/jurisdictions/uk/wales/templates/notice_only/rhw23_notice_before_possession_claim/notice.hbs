    NOTE: Sections 165, 170, 191 (contract-holder's failure to give up possession
    after their own notice) are NOT included in this fault-based notice form.
    That is a SEPARATE route/notice process, not part of RHW23 for breach/arrears/ASB.
    If the contract-holder gave notice to end the contract and failed to leave,
    a different prescribed form and process applies.

  <h2>Guidance notes for contract-holders</h2>
  <p>This notice tells you that your landlord intends to begin proceedings for possession of the dwelling identified at Part C. You should read it carefully and seek advice about your circumstances as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>The earliest date on which possession proceedings can begin will depend on the ground(s) on which possession is sought, which are listed at Part D. Explanations of the restrictions applicable to particular grounds are provided below.</p>

  <p>If you are in any doubt or need advice about any aspect of this notice, you should first contact your landlord. Many problems can be resolved quickly by raising them when they first arise. If you are unable to reach an agreement with your landlord, you may wish to contact an advice agency (such as Citizens Advice Cymru or Shelter Cymru) or independent legal advisors.</p>

  <p>If you believe you are at risk of homelessness as a result of receiving this notice, you should contact your local authority for support.</p>
