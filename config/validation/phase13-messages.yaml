# ENGLAND - SECTION 21 PHASE 13 RULES
# =============================================================================

england_s21:

  s21_deposit_cap_exceeded:
    title: "Deposit Exceeds Legal Cap"
    description: >
      The deposit amount exceeds the legal maximum under the Tenant Fees Act 2019.
      For tenancies where annual rent is £50,000 or less, the deposit cap is 5 weeks' rent.
      For tenancies with annual rent over £50,000, the cap is 6 weeks' rent.
      Section 21 notices are invalid if excess deposit has not been returned to the tenant.
    howToFix:
      - "Calculate the legal deposit cap based on the annual rent"
      - "If deposit exceeds the cap, return the excess amount to the tenant"
      - "Document the return of the excess deposit with receipts or bank transfer evidence"
      - "Once excess is returned, confirm this in the wizard before generating the notice"

  s21_four_month_bar:
    title: "Four-Month Restriction Period"
    description: >
      Section 21 notices cannot be served during the first four months of a tenancy.
      This restriction applies from the date the tenancy began, regardless of any
      renewal or variation of the tenancy terms.
    howToFix:
      - "Check the tenancy start date"
      - "Calculate when 4 months from the start date will have passed"
      - "Wait until after the 4-month period has elapsed before serving the notice"
      - "The notice can be served from day 121 of the tenancy onwards"

  s21_notice_period_short:
    title: "Notice Period Too Short"
    description: >
      The expiry date specified results in a notice period shorter than the
      statutory minimum of 2 months. Section 21 notices must give the tenant
      at least 2 months' notice before the possession date.
    howToFix:
      - "Calculate 2 months from the intended service date"
      - "Ensure the expiry date is at least 2 months after service"
      - "For periodic tenancies, the expiry date should also coincide with the end of a period"
      - "Update the expiry date in the wizard to meet the minimum period"

  s21_licensing_required_not_licensed:
    title: "Selective Licensing Required"
    description: >
      The property is in an area where selective licensing applies, but no valid
      licence is held. Section 21 notices cannot be served on properties that
      require but do not have a valid HMO or selective licence.
    howToFix:
      - "Check if your property is in a selective licensing area with your local council"
      - "If licensing is required, apply for and obtain the appropriate licence"
      - "Ensure the licence is granted and valid before serving the notice"
      - "If you believe licensing is not required, verify with the council and update your answers"

  s21_retaliatory_improvement_notice:
    title: "Improvement Notice Blocks Section 21"
    description: >
      An improvement notice has been served on the property by the local authority.
      Section 21 notices served within 6 months of an improvement notice may be
      invalid under retaliatory eviction protection. This protection exists to
      prevent landlords evicting tenants who complain about property conditions.
    howToFix:
      - "Check if the improvement notice has been fully complied with"
      - "Wait until 6 months have passed since the improvement notice was served"
      - "Alternatively, demonstrate the eviction is not connected to the complaint"
      - "Consider addressing all property issues before proceeding"

      invalid under retaliatory eviction protection. This includes emergency works
      for Category 1 hazards posing imminent risk to health and safety.
    howToFix:
      - "Check when the emergency remedial action was taken"
      - "Wait until 6 months have passed since the action"
      - "Ensure all required remedial works have been completed"
      - "Keep evidence of compliance with any local authority requirements"

    title: "Section 8 Notice Period Too Short"
    description: >
      The notice period does not meet the statutory minimum for the selected grounds.
      Different Section 8 grounds have different minimum notice periods, ranging from
      immediate (Ground 7A anti-social behaviour) to 2 months (discretionary grounds).
    howToFix:
      - "Check the required notice period for your selected grounds"
      - "Mandatory grounds typically require 2 weeks' notice minimum"
      - "Discretionary grounds typically require 2 months' notice"
      - "Set the expiry date to meet the longest required period for your grounds"

wales_s173:

  s173_notice_period_short:
    title: "Section 173 Notice Period Too Short"
    description: >
      Wales Section 173 (no-fault notice) requires a minimum of 6 months' notice.
      This is significantly longer than the 2-month minimum in England, reflecting
      the enhanced tenant protections under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016.
    howToFix:
      - "Calculate 6 months from the intended service date"
      - "Ensure the expiry date is at least 6 months after service"
      - "Update the expiry date in the wizard to meet the 6-month minimum"

    description: >
      The deposit must be protected in an approved tenancy deposit scheme before
      serving a Section 173 notice. In Wales, deposits must be protected within
      30 days of receipt. An unprotected deposit invalidates no-fault notices.
    howToFix:
      - "Protect the deposit in an approved scheme (DPS, MyDeposits, or TDS)"
      - "Ensure protection occurred within 30 days of receiving the deposit"
      - "Serve the prescribed information to the contract holder"
      - "Confirm deposit protection status in the wizard before proceeding"

  s173_written_statement_missing:
    title: "Written Statement Not Provided"
    description: >
      Wales law requires landlords to provide a written statement of the occupation
      contract to contract holders. This must be provided within 14 days of the
      occupation date. Not providing this may affect your ability to obtain possession.
    howToFix:
      - "Prepare a written statement of the occupation contract"
      - "Include all required terms under Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016"
      - "Serve the written statement on the contract holder"

  ntl_landlord_not_registered:
    title: "Landlord Registration Required"
    description: >
      Scotland requires all private landlords to be registered with the Scottish
      Landlord Register. Serving a Notice to Leave without valid registration
      may result in the notice being invalid and potential criminal penalties.
    howToFix:
      - "Register with the Scottish Landlord Register at landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk"
      - "Ensure your registration is up to date and covers the property"
      - "Enter your landlord registration number in the wizard"

  ntl_pre_action_letter_not_sent:
    title: "Pre-Action Letter Required"
    description: >
      Before serving a Ground 1 (rent arrears) Notice to Leave, you must send
      the tenant a pre-action letter giving them 28 days' notice of your intention
      to seek possession. This is a mandatory step under Scottish pre-action requirements.
    howToFix:
      - "Send a pre-action letter to the tenant"
      - "The letter must give at least 28 days' notice"
      - "Include information about the arrears amount and how to pay"

    title: "Arrears May Be Insufficient for Ground 1"
    description: >
      While Ground 1 can technically be used with any level of arrears, tribunals
      in Scotland typically expect substantial arrears (usually 3+ months) before
      granting possession. Proceeding with lower arrears may result in the
      application being refused.
    howToFix:
      - "Consider waiting until arrears reach at least 3 months' rent"
      - "Document all arrears with rent statements and payment records"
      - "Ensure you have followed all pre-action requirements"
      - "Consider alternative grounds if arrears are below 3 months"
