In England and Wales your deposit can be registered with:\nDeposit Protection Service\nMyDeposits  - including deposits that were held by Capita\nTenancy Deposit Scheme\nIf you do not rent your home on an assured shorthold tenancy, your landlord can accept valuable items (for example a car or watch) as a deposit instead of money. The items will not be protected by a scheme.\nThey make sure you’ll get your deposit back if you:\nmeet the terms of your tenancy agreement\ndo not damage the property\npay your rent and bills\nYour landlord or letting agent must put your deposit in the scheme within 30 days of getting it.\nIf you’re in Scotland or Northern Ireland\nThere are separate  TDP  schemes in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Find out about:\nTDP  schemes in Scotland\nTDP  schemes in Northern Ireland\nAt the end of your tenancy\nYour landlord must return your deposit within 10 days of you both agreeing how much you’ll get back.\nIf you’re in a dispute with your landlord, then your deposit will be protected in the  TDP  scheme until the issue is sorted out.\nHolding deposits\nYour landlord does not have to protect a holding deposit (money you pay to ‘hold’ a property before an agreement is signed). Once you become a tenant, the holding deposit becomes a deposit, which they must protect.\nDeposits made by a third party\nYour landlord must use a  TDP  scheme even if your deposit is paid by someone else, such as a rent deposit scheme or your parents.\nNext\n:\nInformation landlords must give tenants\nView a printable version of the whole guide\nRelated content\nPrivate renting\nPrivate renting for tenants: tenancy agreements\nPrivate renting for tenants: evictions in England\nExplore the topic\nRenting a property\nIs this page useful?\nMaybe\nYes  this page is useful\nNo  this page is not useful\nThank you for your feedback\nReport a problem with this page\nHelp us improve GOV.UK\nDon’t include personal or financial information like your National Insurance number or credit card details.\nThis field is for robots only.
