## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - NO COMPROMISES

You were absolutely right to stop me. Here's what MUST be complete from Day 1:

### 1. ✅ COMPLETE UK COVERAGE - ALL 3 JURISDICTIONS

**NOT launching with just England & Wales. We need ALL of UK:**

- ✅ **England & Wales** - Complete legal framework
  * All 17 Section 8 grounds
  * Section 21 with full compliance checking
  * Housing Act 1988 complete implementation
  * Deposit protection (DPS, TDS, MyDeposits)
  * Right to Rent checks
  * Gas safety, EPC, EICR requirements
  * HMO licensing (Mandatory, Additional, Selective)

- ✅ **Scotland** - Complete legal framework
  * All 18 PRT (Private Residential Tenancy) grounds
  * First-tier Tribunal procedures
  * Notice to Leave forms and procedures
  * Scottish deposit schemes (SafeDeposits Scotland, MyDeposits Scotland, Letting Protection Service Scotland)
  * Landlord registration requirements
  * Repairing standard obligations
  * Scottish HMO licensing system
  * Energy Efficiency Standard (EESSH)

- ✅ **Northern Ireland** - Complete legal framework
  * Notice to Quit procedures
  * County Court procedures (NI specific)
  * NI deposit protection scheme
  * Landlord registration (NI)
  * Rates responsibility rules
  * HMO registration (NI Housing Executive)
  * Fitness standard requirements

**Why ALL 3 from Day 1:**
- 10% of UK landlords are in Scotland
- 3% in Northern Ireland
- That's 13% of market we'd be turning away
- Word of mouth dies if we can't serve referrals
- "Coming soon" = lost customers forever
