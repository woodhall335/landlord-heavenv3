🏛️ LANDLORD HEAVEN — MASTER BLUEPRINT (2025–2026 EDITION)

Version: 10.0
Date: December 2025
Status: Authoritative Source of Truth (Product + Legal + Technical)

PART 1/5
1. OVERVIEW

Landlord Heaven is the UK’s first end-to-end landlord legal automation platform, covering every stage of the tenancy lifecycle across England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

It is designed to replace 70–80% of the work traditionally performed by:

High-street solicitors

Letting agents

Paralegals

HMO consultants

Drafting services

The platform delivers full legal-document assembly, evidence ingestion, automated compliance checking, and council/form routing — all via one unified flow built on MQS, Ask Heaven™, and the Official Forms Engine.

1.1 Core Capabilities (Full Vision)

✔ Eviction (E&W Section 8, Section 21, N5/N5B/N119, Scotland Tribunal, NI NTQ workflow)
✔ Money Claims (England & Wales N1, Scotland Simple Procedure Form 3A)
✔ Tenancy Agreements (AST, PRT, NI Tenancy)
✔ HMO Licensing Suite (Standard + Premium)
✔ Ask Heaven™ AI Co-Pilot (senior-solicitor persona)
✔ Master Question Sets (MQS) for all workflows
✔ Automated compliance scoring
✔ Evidence upload + AI extraction
✔ Real-time validation & rule enforcement
✔ Official PDF generation
✔ User dashboard with timeline + regeneration
✔ Admin portal with template control + legal scrapers
✔ Jurisdiction-aware routing for E&W, Scotland, NI

**V1 SCOPE (Current Release):**
- ✅ **England & Wales:** Evictions, Money Claims, Tenancy Agreements
- ✅ **Scotland:** Evictions, Money Claims, Tenancy Agreements
- ✅ **Northern Ireland:** Tenancy Agreements ONLY

- ❌ **Northern Ireland Money Claims:** V2+ Roadmap (Q2 2026)

V1 focuses on core eviction, money claim, and tenancy agreement workflows for England & Wales and Scotland, with tenancy agreements available for Northern Ireland. NI eviction/money claim workflows and the HMO Licensing Suite are intentionally excluded from V1 and planned for V2.

4. Ask Heaven™
5. MQS (Master Question Sets)
6. Unified Conversational Flow

4. ASK HEAVEN™ — AI LEGAL CO-PILOT

Ask Heaven is the AI assistant layer that runs alongside every product — but Ask Heaven is NOT the wizard.
The wizard is MQS.
Ask Heaven is the expert that improves answers, checks reasoning, and prevents user mistakes.

4.1 Purpose of Ask Heaven

Ask Heaven ensures that:

User inputs are complete, clear, and court-ready

The platform catches red flags early

Users are guided toward legally compliant explanations

Answers are phrased in a manner suitable for official forms

There is no missing evidence or contradictory information

Ask Heaven does not replace solicitors — but it replicates the guided drafting support a solicitor gives.

4.2 Ask Heaven Capabilities (Full List)
✔ Summarisation

Ask Heaven converts unclear or emotional text into structured summaries.

Example:
User: “He smashed the door and was screaming last night again.”
Ask Heaven summary:
→ “Tenant caused property damage to the internal bedroom door and engaged in threatening behaviour on 15 November 2025.”

✔ Missing Information Detection

If the user says “Tenant owes rent,” Ask Heaven asks:

Since when?

How much per month?

What payments have been made?

Any repayment discussions?

✔ Risk Flagging

Ask Heaven warns about:

Deposit not protected

Wrong notice type

Illegal eviction risks

Insufficient evidence for ASB

Incomplete safety certificates

Defective HMO licensing

✔ Suggesting Improvements

Turns weak statements into court-appropriate clarity.

Before:
“He’s noisy.”
After:
“The tenant has caused repeated excessive noise disturbances, recorded on 4, 8, and 11 August 2025, in breach of clause 4.3 of the tenancy agreement.”

✔ Legal Context Explanation (Non-Advisory)

Provides high-level context only, such as:

HMO requirements

Section 8 grounds

Tribunal timelines

Certificate requirements

Deposit rules

Always factual, never strategic.

✔ Evidence Guidance

Suggests what evidence strengthens the case:

Bank statements

Rent ledger

Crime reports

Photos

Contractor invoices

Safety certificates

✔ Form Fill Preparation

It restructures answers so they fit correctly into:

N119

N1

Form E

Form 3A

HMO amenity sections

ASB narratives

4.3 Ask Heaven Strict Boundaries
❌ Ask Heaven Absolutely Cannot:

Advise whether a landlord should evict

Tell landlord which legal strategy to pursue

✔ It CAN:

5. MASTER QUESTION SETS (MQS)

MQS is the backbone of the entire platform.

It replaces unpredictable AI-only flows with a deterministic question engine.

Every product, every jurisdiction, every form is powered by MQS.

5.1 Purpose of MQS

MQS ensures:

No missing fields

No unasked mandatory questions

No incomplete evidence

Perfect mapping to official forms

Deterministic data structure

Full jurisdiction logic

Predictable generation

Instant regeneration

It is the “compiler” for user inputs → legal outputs.

5.2 MQS File Structure

Each workflow has its own YAML file:

/config/mqs/<workflow>/<jurisdiction>.yaml


Example:

/config/mqs/eviction/england-wales.yaml
/config/mqs/hmo/england-wales.yaml
/config/mqs/money-claim/scotland.yaml

5.3 Anatomy of an MQS Question

Every question includes:

id: unique_field_name
question: "What date did the tenancy begin?"
type: date | text | select | boolean | number | multi_select | upload
required: true | false
validation:
  regex: ...
  zod: ...
suggestion: "Ask Heaven prompt for improved answer"
maps_to:
  - official_form_name.field_id
  - pdf_template.field_name
conditions:
  - rule: only if jurisdiction = "scotland"
  - rule: only if tenancy_type = "assured"
jurisdictions:
  - england-wales
  - scotland
  - northern-ireland
help_text: Additional guidance
ai_checks:
  - check_for_missing_dates

5.4 How MQS Maps to Official Documents

MQS drives every part of the document engine:

N5, N5B, N119

N1 (E&W)

Form 3A (Scotland)

Form E (Scotland)

All HMO council forms

AST/PRT/NI tenancy docs

Mapping is direct and deterministic:

rent_arrears.total -> N119.section4.amount
tenant_name -> FormE.page1.tenant.name
property_address -> N1.claimant.address
hmo.room1.size -> ManchesterCouncilForm.room_dimensions[0]


There is no guesswork.

🏛️ LANDLORD HEAVEN — MASTER BLUEPRINT

Version: 10.0
PART 5/5
Sections:
13. Legal Compliance
14. Commercial Strategy
15. Growth Forecast
16. Future Work
17. Final Notes

13. LEGAL COMPLIANCE (FULL RULESET & BEHAVIOURAL GUARDRAILS)

Landlord Heaven is a legal-information platform, not a solicitor practice.
All flows must strictly adhere to compliance boundaries.

This section defines EXACT behaviour, limits, and legal obligations.

13.1 Foundations of Legal Compliance

The system ensures:

✔ Use of official forms only

Courts do not accept replicas.
We store:

/public/official-forms/**
/public/official-hmo-forms/<council>/**

✔ Compliance with statutory minimum content

Section 8 (Housing Act 1988)

Section 21 (Form 6A — Prescribed Form)

PRT rules (Private Housing (Tenancies) Act 2016)

NI Notice to Quit (Housing Order 2006)

N1/N5/N5B/N119 official forms

Simple Procedure (Form 3A)

HMO rules per council

✔ All document generation is factual automation, never advice
✔ Ask Heaven NEVER:

Tells users what to do

Advises on strategy

Recommends legal routes

Suggests how to win a case

Predicts court outcomes

Makes legal arguments

✔ Ask Heaven ALWAYS:

Helps clarify factual descriptions

Detects contradictions

Warns of missing evidence

Explains procedural rules

Highlights deposit or licensing issues

All outputs follow a neutral, formal, risk-aware tone.

13.2 Jurisdiction Guardrails

The system enforces jurisdiction-specific rules automatically:

England & Wales

Blocks Section 21 if deposit compliance missing

Blocks accelerated possession if tenancy is not AST

Checks EPC C requirements where relevant

Checks for licensing (HMO)

Validates notice periods

Applies court fee calculations

Validates safety documents

Scotland

Detects PRT

Blocks old AST workflows

Ensures Tribunal route only

Validates Notice to Leave

Applies mandatory/discretionary grounds

Northern Ireland

Uses NI-specific Notice to Quit rules

Blocks money claim pack

Identifies tenancy type via NI criteria

Applies NI expiry durations (anti-2022 reforms)

If a user enters incorrect jurisdiction flows:

→ The system halts and re-routes.

13.3 Deposit Protection Compliance

Deposit rules drive multiple sections.

England & Wales

If unprotected → S21 invalid

If PI not served → S21 invalid

Ask Heaven flags risk

Decision engine blocks s21

Scotland

Deposit scheme required

Notices still valid but case impact is explained

Northern Ireland

NI Deposit Schemes enforced

Valid NTQ requires compliance

13.4 Data Protection & Security Compliance

Fully GDPR compliant

Encryption at rest (Supabase Storage)

RLS policies for row-level security

Logs anonymised where possible

Ask Heaven conversations stored only for QA

User can export/delete all data.

13.5 Automated Scrapers & Legal Updates

Daily scrapers check:

Gov.uk form updates

Court form modifications

Tribunal rule changes

HMO council changes

Deposit scheme updates

Admin must approve scraper changes before deployment.

13.6 Document Authenticity

The system never generates replicas of:

N1

N5

N5B

N119

Form 6A

Form 3A

NI court forms

Only official PDFs are filled.

13.7 “No Advice” Boundary Enforcement
Ask Heaven is configured with guardrails to refuse:

“Should I evict?”

“Which route is best?”

“What’s my likelihood of success?”

“What should I claim for?”

“Should I choose Standard or Premium?”

“What should I write on the form?”

Instead it replies with factual context:
“Here is what that form typically includes…”
